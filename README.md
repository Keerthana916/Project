**Project Portfolio:**

Welcome to my collection of data science and machine learning projects. Each notebook demonstrates a specific domain application using real-world or publicly available datasets, with the aim of solving practical problems through data-driven methods.

**Projects Overview:**

1. Cell Phone Price Range Prediction
* Objective: Predict the price range (low to high) of mobile phones based on features such as battery, RAM, screen size, and connectivity.
* Techniques: EDA, Correlation Analysis, Feature Engineering, Classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, ANN).
* Outcome: Achieved 95â€“96% accuracy with SVM and KNN models.
* Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
2. Employee Performance Analysis
* Objective: Analyze employee performance data to identify factors influencing high performance and potential attrition.
* Techniques: Data preprocessing, EDA, classification models, feature importance analysis.
* Outcome: Identified top features affecting employee performance and built models to predict high/low performers.
* Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
3. Flight Price Prediction
* Objective: Predict the price of airline tickets based on variables like airline, departure time, stops, and duration.
* Techniques: Feature extraction from date/time, one-hot encoding, regression models.
* Outcome: XGBoost provided the most accurate results, outperforming linear and tree-based regressors.
* Tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, GridSearchCV
4. Heart Disease Prediction
* Objective: Classify whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes.
* Techniques: EDA, feature scaling, model evaluation (ROC-AUC, confusion matrix), logistic regression, ensemble models.
* Outcome: Random Forest and SVM models achieved high accuracy and recall scores, useful in healthcare diagnostics.
* Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
5. Portuguese Bank Marketing Project
* Objective: Predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (yes/no) based on banking and socio-economic factors.
* Techniques: Handling class imbalance, logistic regression, tree-based models, precision-recall analysis.
* Outcome: Improved targeting strategy by identifying key indicators (e.g., contact duration, previous outcomes).
* Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, SMOTE
6. Sales Effectiveness Analysis
* Objective: Improve sales performance by analyzing customer, sales, and conversion data.
* Techniques: Lead scoring, segmentation, correlation analysis, decision tree classification.
* Outcome: Identified key factors that influence conversions; provided recommendations for sales strategy optimization.
* Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
7. Texas Salary Prediction
