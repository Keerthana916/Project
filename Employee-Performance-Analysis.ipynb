    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "1. **It’s a Classification Problem**\n",
    "* The target variable, PerformanceRating, is categorical (values: 2, 3, 4).\n",
    "* Problem addressed using supervised classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Best Performing Models**\n",
    "* Random Forest and Gradient Boosting both achieved ~93% accuracy.\n",
    "* Models performed exceptionally well after handling class imbalance using SMOTE and applying feature scaling.\n",
    "* These models can reliably predict employee performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Top Factors Affecting Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "   From correlation and model insights:\n",
    "* EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction : Strong Positive\n",
    "* EmpLastSalaryHikePercent : Positive\n",
    "* YearsSinceLastPromotion : Negative\n",
    "* ExperienceYearsInCurrentRole : Slight Negative\n",
    "* DistanceFromHome : Weak Negative\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "1. Boost Work Environment & Recognition\n",
    "* Higher satisfaction and timely salary hikes are tied to better performance.\n",
    "* Improve work-life balance and implement fair appraisal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encourage Growth & Promotions\n",
    "* Long stagnation in the same role or no promotion → linked to reduced performance.\n",
    "* Create internal mobility and growth programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data-Driven HR Practices\n",
    "* Deploy the trained model in the recruitment pipeline to predict likely top performers.\n",
    "* Continuously monitor performance indicators for early intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science solution effectively identifies performance patterns and enables INX Future Inc. to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predict employee performance with 93% accuracy,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improve retention of high performers,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make informed talent decisions,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preserve its reputation as a top employer."
